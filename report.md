## Research Summary: Advances in Recommender Systems

### 1. Deep Learning based Recommender System: A Survey and New Perspectives
This 2018 paper published in ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) by Zhang, Yao, and Sun explores how deep learning can be utilized in recommender systems to improve performance. They highlight the accuracy and ability of deep learning-based recommender systems to handle complex patterns.

### 2. BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback
This 2009 research by Rendle, Freudenthaler, Gantner, and Schmidt-Thieme introduces the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) algorithm. Published in the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence proceedings, BPR optimizes personalized ranking in recommendation systems, especially in cases of implicit feedback.

### 3. Hybrid Recommender Systems: Survey and Experiments
Published in User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction journal in 2002, Robin Burke's research provides an in-depth look into hybrid recommender systems. These systems combine multiple recommendation techniques to improve performance. A comprehensive taxonomy of strategies is offered, with evaluations across different user models and data sets.

### 4. Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering in a Cold Start Context: The Impact of User Profile Size on the Quality of Recommendation
El Hassani and Behja's 2017 research published in Information Sciences delves into the difficulties of cross-domain recommendation and the 'cold start' issue for users with limited profiles. A novel cross-domain collaborative filtering approach is proposed that optimizes recommendation quality in a cold-start context.

### 5. Addressing Cold-Start Problem in Recommendation Systems by Bipartite Network Projection
Published in 2020 in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, Lu, Zhou, Xiao, Duan, Ye, and Li offer a new solution to the 'cold start' problem in recommendation systems. By creating a user-item bipartite network, the network is projected onto the user-side resulting in a user-user weighted network, which improves recommendation accuracy.

## Proposed Research Directions:

1. **Comparison of Deep Learning Algorithms in Recommender Systems:** Assess the effectiveness and efficiency of various deep learning algorithms within the context of recommendation systems.
   
2. **Application of BPR in Hybrid Recommender Systems:** Investigate the suitability and impact of applying Bayesian Personalized Ranking in hybrid recommender systems.
   
3. **Evaluation of Different Hybrid Recommender System Strategies Against 'Cold Start' Problem:** Perform an evaluation on how the 'cold start' problem is addressed by different hybrid recommender system strategies.
   
4. **Impact of User Profile Completeness on Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering:** Examine how the completeness of a user's profile influences the quality of recommendations given by cross-domain collaborative filtering.
   
5. **Using Bipartite Network Projection in Deep Learning-based Recommender Systems:** Explore the impact of employing bipartite network projection technique in deep learning-based recommender systems.
   
Each proposed direction expands upon the insights gained from the papers discussed, aiming to fill existing knowledge gaps and offer new ways to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of recommender systems.

# Comprehensive Review on Recommendation Systems 

This report outlines the emerging trend and future perspectives related to Recommendation Systems, as achieved from a range of sources. 

## 1. Deep Learning-based Recommender System

The paper "Deep Learning based Recommender System: A Survey and New Perspectives" [1] points out that recommending systems function by identifying patterns of user interest and activity. A deep learning-based approach is posited to make this process more efficient and personalized.

## 2. Application of Recommender System

"A Survey of Recommender Systems and Their Applications" [2] highlights the significance of recommender systems in various sectors such as e-commerce sites, streaming services, and social media platforms. These systems enhance user experience by suggesting items based on user behavioural patterns and preferences.

## 3. Bayesian Personalized Ranking for Individual Item Ranking

"BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback" [3] emphasizes the importance of recommendation systems in handling implicit feedback and introduces Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) for individual item ranking.

## 4. Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets

Collaboration of Implicit Feedback Datasets with matrix factorization model is revealed in "Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets" [4]. This model is found to be a common practice in recommendation systems due to its potential to handle large implicit feedback datasets smoothly.

## 5. The YouTube Video Recommendation System

"The YouTube video recommendation system" [5] throws light on the crucial role of recommendation systems in retaining a user base on platforms like YouTube. 

## Proposed Research Directions

The following questions merit further attention: 

1. What are refined metrics and methods to assess the reliability and efficiency of deep-learning-based Recommender Systems?
2. The application of Recommender Systems could be beneficial in less popular or unconventional platforms or industries. 
3. Research should direct its focus to make implicit feedback more fruitful in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) for recommendation systems.
4. A rigorous investigation is needed on alternatives to the matrix factorization model or improving its efficiency for handling larger implicit feedback datasets.
5. Research on AI-based Recommender Systems could be directed towards optimization of real-time adaptability and boost user engagement.

This provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research and paves the way for future studies in the rapidly changing field of Recommendation Systems.

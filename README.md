# CrewAI Multi-Agent Research Assistant

## Overview
This project implements a multi-agent research assistant using CrewAI.
It automates literature search, summarization, and idea generation for research topics (e.g., recommendation systems).
The system integrates agents with distinct roles such as Researcher, Analyst, and Writer, collaborating to streamline research workflows.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to explore multi-agent systems and create a smart assistant that reduces repetitive research tasks, saving time for gathering and synthesizing literature.

## Key Features
-  Automated literature retrieval 
-  Summarization and synthesis of research findings
- Export results to Markdown (report.md)
- Customizable agent roles and tasks

## Tech Stack
- Python (CrewAI)
- OpenAI GPT models

## Installation
Ensure Python >=3.10 <3.14 is installed. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
crewai install
```

2.Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env

3.Run the project

```bash
crewai run
```
This generates report.md with the research results.


## How it works
The crewai_project Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.

## Demo/Output

Example research report generated by the AI agents:

```markdown
# Comprehensive Review on Recommendation Systems

This report outlines the emerging trends and future perspectives related to Recommendation Systems, as achieved from a range of sources.

## 1. Deep Learning-based Recommender Systems
